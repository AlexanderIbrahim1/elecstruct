# TODO

Some things to improve the code:
- [DONE] speed up the creation of the Hermitian matrices in the HF method
- [DONE] perform a check to skip the calculation of two-electron integrals that will end up as 0
- add more molecule examples aside from just water
- perform cleaner separation of source and header
